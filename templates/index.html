        <p>Opengrid is a collaborative project about energy and building data mining and automation. We believe
        there is a need for open source tools to analyse utility data, smart meter output, comfort measurements etc and to
        gain knowledge from these data streams. This knowledge can then be used to understand consumption patterns, realize
        energy savings, build smart automation applications, enable demand response, ...</p>
